[1] urban_rural_equity
Prompt: Urban city skyline with many sensor icons vs rural village with zero sensors, both covered by same red pollution cloud. Split screen comparison showing unequal monitoring coverage. Clean infographic style, blue and orange colors.

[2] budget_constraint
Prompt: Simple diagram showing budget constraint: dollar signs and sensor icons, with a budget cap bar showing limited resources. Clean infographic showing that placement matters more than count. White background, green and red colors.

[5] gdmi_pipeline_steps
Prompt: Three step pipeline diagram: 1) Predict values at proposed locations 2) Impute as if observed 3) Recompute uncertainty. Arrows connecting the steps. Clean flowchart style.

[6] before_after_uncertainty
Prompt: Before and after comparison: Left shows high uncertainty heatmap (red/orange), Right shows reduced uncertainty after sensor placement (blue/green). Side by side with arrow between.

[7] policy_impact_flow
Prompt: Flow diagram: Sensors icon -> ML Model icon -> Policy document icon -> Health/people icon. Showing the impact pipeline from measurement to health outcomes. Clean infographic style.
